% give a lot of examples of usages of notebooks in laboratories
% mistakes made then, that will be overcomed with IPython
% the way of writing, connected with IPython again

To clearly understand the problem that this project is trying to solve, we have to go into detail about the concept of using computational applications. The central hypothesis of the research is to analyse over the usage of software in science. However, this area of study wraps great deal of use cases - it can not be measured with general algorithms. A lot of journals and projects that are using coding, would be the evidence and solution of the raised questions - is software helpful for science?; why do we have to use software in analysis?; how a completely different area of study can benefit from the usage of programming scripts? 

\subsection*{Contributions}

Software has contributed to a lot of areas of study.

\subsection*{Approach}

A great deal of researches and journals have been conducted for answering the above questions, which later led to to the idea of observing these investigations in order to assess broadly if software is worth practicing. 

\subsection*{Methodology and Outcomes}

This section explains how we are assessing the usage of software given all of its history in science.
