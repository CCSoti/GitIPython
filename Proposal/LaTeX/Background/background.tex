At the University of Texas at Austin, Tal Yarkoni
uses the IPython notebook to run automated
meta-analyses of brain imaging studies to
uncover patterns of neural activity involved in
language processing, emotion and other processes.
The psychoinformatician plans to publish
the notebooks as companions to his future
journal articles. “The more complicated the
analyses, the greater the benefits of being able to convey all that in one simple document,” he says.
