Software development projects, scientific researches and teaching computing science are difficult to organise, document and present. Reviewing a piece of code or publishing it has always required explanation and so far it has been recorded as a comment in the code or as a text file. This method of reporting analysis and algorithms is ineffective for the productivity and concentration of project's developers. 

Python is a programming language that is known as an easy to learn, code and prominent for data analysis, except that it has an inconvenient shell. Running, testing, debugging and documenting Python scripts has required the usage of various software tools, such as the command prompt (or another command-line interpreters), text editors and others. 

To overcome this drawback of Python, IPython has been created as a software tool, interactive shell for standard scientific Python scripts, that allows combination of styled text, code and data visualizations. It is designed to stimulate the writing, testing and debugging of Python code and it has a productive environment for analytical computing. \cite{mckinney2012python} Running Python scripts is effective for immediate response, since developers can see the results right away.

Is IPython crucial and compelling software tool for researches and journals? The answer of this question can be achieved by analyzing data taken from GitHub - Web-based Git repository hosting service. \cite{gitHubWiki} GitHub is one of the most crucial web-sites as a source of information  on the Internet. A huge number of researchers have started to investigate and anlayze GitHub repostories so that they can understand how users are exploiting the site for collaboration on software. \cite{kalliamvakou2007promises}
