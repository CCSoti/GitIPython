RQ1: Are repositories stand alone, what are the iPython communities/interdependencies?

Analysis: cloning between scripts

 1. Extract all code cells from iPython scripts.
 2. Perform a pairwise string comparison between cells.
 3. Look for clusters of similar cells.
 4. Look for clusters of related scripts.
 5. Look for clusters of related projects.
 6. Are there commonalities between the related projects (e.g. similar authors).  Is there a cloning relationship between the repositories (common parent?).
 7.
