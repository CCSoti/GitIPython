RQ1: Are repositories stand alone, what are the iPython communities/interdependencies?

Analysis: cloning between scripts

 1. Extract all code cells from iPython scripts.
 2. Perform a pairwise string comparison between cells.
 3. Look for clusters of similar cells.
 4. Look for clusters of related scripts.
 5. Look for clusters of related projects.
 6. Are there commonalities between the related projects (e.g. similar authors).  Is there a cloning relationship between the repositories (common parent?).
 7.

 RQ2: IPython repositories' features

 1. Are the scripts executable - any errors, types of errors?
 2. Do they have LICENSE or README file?
 3. How much code vs. text(markdown) each script contain?
 4. The most used Python packages in the repositories

 RQ3: GitHub repository's features (only projects having IPython scripts)

 1. Number of commits.
 2. Number of contributors.
 3. Start date and end date.
 4. Relations between the features (graphs).
