\begin{abstract}

Scientists have been developing various idea so that they can maintain, share and replace long data science workflows. One of the most popular approaches is the usage of notebooks, which gain most of its attractiveness with the support of IPython Notebook. Since 2001, IPython grew out of the scientific computing community and it has developed features that are sufficient for data scientists. Exploratory data analysis need great support from an interactive environment for effective maintenance and usage. IPython has been developed for powerful and practical interaction with data. It also addresses other important pain aspects for scientists - reproducibility and collaboration - issues that are equally important to data scientists working in industry.

The project is analyzing in detail the IPython Notebook usage into the fields of scientific research and software development. A popular and effective place for sharing various researches and contributions for projects is the open source hosting service GitHub. This research is investigating GitHub, since it allows tracking of data changes, commits, issues and documentation.
