MSci Research Projects

In this stage you carry out your investigation of the agreed research problem, with guidance from your supervisor. You should meet your supervisor once per week. This starts in semester 1 (once the research proposal is complete) and continues throughout semester 2.

If your research project involves human participation, you must read and follow the Schoolâ€™s ethics guidelines.

By the end of semester 2 you must submit a scientific paper that presents the results of your investigation. Your scientific paper must reflect work of Masters character and quality, including a well-defined thesis and argument; evidence of a substantial literature survey; research using appropriate methods and presentation of valid results; and critical evaluation of the results, their significance, and their relationship to other relevant work. The scientific paper can be at most 14 pages and must use the provided latex class file.

It is essential that you allow yourself enough time (several weeks) to write your dissertation, since your project work will be assessed mainly on the dissertation.

In addition to the scientific paper, you will give an Oral Presentation of your investigation to the relevant research group.
